# UTMQuest

utmQuest is an online student-driven study tool geared towards UTM students. This tool offers students a repository of questions that they can use to practice and review concepts related to any courses they are currently taking.

Users can add questions to the repository by essentially opening a "pull request" where other students will then review the question and approve it. 

Students can also participate in discussion threads for any questions to clarify their understanding or offer feedback for others.
